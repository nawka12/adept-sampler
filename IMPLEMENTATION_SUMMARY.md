## 🎛️ Available Nodes

1. **Adept Scheduler** - Generates custom sigma schedules
2. **Adept Sampler (ComfyUI)** - Full-featured ComfyUI-compatible sampler
3. **Adept Sampler (Simple)** - Simplified all-in-one interface

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone <this-repo>
```

### Basic Usage
1. Add `Adept Scheduler` node
2. Set scheduler to "Entropic" 
3. Add `Adept Sampler (ComfyUI)` node
4. Connect scheduler output to sampler
5. Connect your model, conditioning, and latent inputs
6. Lower CFG by 1-2 points
7. Generate!

### Recommended First Settings
```
Scheduler: Entropic
Steps: 25
Entropic Power: 6.0
Detail Enhancement: Enabled (0.05 strength)
Content-Aware Pacing: Disabled initially
CFG: Your normal CFG - 1.5
```

## 🔍 Key Differences from Original

### Architecture Changes
- **Node-based**: Split into separate scheduler and sampler nodes
- **ComfyUI Types**: Uses SIGMAS, MODEL, CONDITIONING types
- **No Global State**: Settings passed through node parameters
- **Modular Design**: Can mix with other ComfyUI sampling components

### Interface Changes
- **Parameter Organization**: Grouped by functionality
- **Type Safety**: ComfyUI's type system ensures correct connections
- **Visual Workflow**: Easy to see parameter flow in node graph
- **Batch Processing**: Inherits ComfyUI's batch capabilities

### Feature Parity
All original features are preserved:
- ✅ All 7 scheduler types
- ✅ Content-aware pacing with coherence detection
- ✅ Detail enhancement with torchvision
- ✅ Manual pacing overrides
- ✅ Debug capabilities
- ✅ Progressive enhancement
- ✅ Ancestral noise controls

## 📚 Documentation

- **README_COMFYUI.md**: Complete feature documentation
- **examples/basic_workflow_guide.md**: Step-by-step setup guide
- **Original README.md**: Research background and theory

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Usage Requirements
- **CFG Adjustment**: Lower CFG by 1-2 points with custom schedulers
- **Step Count**: Use 25+ steps for best results with advanced features
- **Model Compatibility**: Match AOS variant to model prediction type
- **Torchvision**: Install for detail enhancement features

### Performance Considerations
- **Detail Enhancement**: Adds computational overhead
- **Content-Aware Pacing**: Requires variance calculations
- **Higher Step Counts**: Needed for effective two-phase sampling

### Compatibility
- **ComfyUI Version**: Tested with current ComfyUI
- **Model Types**: Works with all Stable Diffusion variants
- **Extensions**: Compatible with ControlNet, LoRA, etc.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Model Interface**: Simplified model calling (could be enhanced)
2. **Callback Integration**: Basic progress callback support
3. **Noise Sampling**: Uses basic torch.randn (could use ComfyUI's noise system)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Better ComfyUI noise sampler integration
- [ ] Enhanced model calling interface
- [ ] Additional callback features
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] More granular control options
- [ ] Integration with ComfyUI's advanced sampling features
