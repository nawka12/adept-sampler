# Adept Sampler

This repository contains an advanced, highly customizable sampler for Stable Diffusion WebUI and reForge. It integrates state-of-the-art techniques to provide enhanced detail, flexible scheduling, and improved image composition.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility

This extension is developed and tested on **Stable Diffusion WebUI reForge**. Compatibility with other versions, such as the original WebUI or WebUI Forge, is not guaranteed.

## üåü Features

- **Advanced Ancestral Sampler**: A custom implementation that patches the default Euler Ancestral sampler to provide advanced features.
- **Detail Enhancement**: A unique method to enhance high-frequency details, which can be used with any scheduler.
- **Custom Schedulers**:
    - **Anime-Optimized Schedule (AOS)**: A three-phase scheduler designed to improve composition and detail for anime-style images.
    - **Entropic Schedule**: A power-based schedule that clusters steps for fine-tuning detail generation.
- **Content-Aware Pacing (AOS Only)**: Dynamically adjusts the sampling process, switching from composition to detail focus based on image coherence.
- **Full UI Integration**: All features are configurable through a custom accordion panel in the WebUI or reForge interface.
